<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![FMAPV][BK4A]](https://github.com/bank4all/BK4A.html)

Main activity of a bank before receiving any cash or play the garantor for a transaction is to insure their own system are not compromised, corrupted or leaking

It does start by internal audit of memory state, program state, entropy state of each automates

For a simple bank, it could be a simple switch off/switch on 

Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email`, `email_client`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

* [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17)
* [Github.io](https://github.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Bank worker are divided into mainly two categories
stamp your name of automate result ( poor reward per task but easy )
stamp your name on transaction text and referential-key ( high reward but risky and difficult )

Bank controller are divided mostly into two roles
maintain a enought CPU/GPU power to run the automates
update/stop/alert/punish on compromised automates

Bank referal are divided mostly into two categories
Saler who brought customers together in order to perform a transaction as garantor and cash runner ( short term low reward, high penalties )
Buyer who affect a credit rate on a project to bring future customers or raise their credit ( long term high reward, high penalties )

Bank trading and structuration are divided into categories
Hedging and protecting the margin of all operations possibile on a quoted market or auctions ( low reward, low penalties )
Modelisation type of operation that get close to a full hedge ( high reward, high penalties )

Bank risk assestment are divided into 
Risk before transaction or agreement ( high reward, very complex job , high penalties )
Risk controller and alerter ( low reward, simple job , low penalties )

Bank automaticians are doing 2 things split apart by chinese wall 
Change automate , update, deploy and receive feedback from customers and any bank tasker
Administrator / Audit and controller of system that punish / revole grant/ ban and track compromised action and their owner

Bank Legal 
Conduct intrusive audit on automates, on people task, on actions and operations, take action before contagion and sign code of conduct, code of operations and code of running
( low reward , low legal risk )
Use detection , filter and collaborate to report suspicious activity within or outside of the bank activity , report to TRACFIN and represent all operations they stamped with complete authority
( high rewards, high legal risk )

Bank governors and directors
Conduct credit policy , investment level, type of operations, open bank activity or close them, seek subventions or public finance,  
( Very complex job, short term low reward, high risk, long term high reward, need to supervise all markets changes and futures returns, anticipate crisis  )
Conduct partnership, business developpement and investors relations , as it is a bank for all, investors will be of the form on Collaterized-Bond 
( Very complex job, short term high reward, short term low risk, long term high risk, need to supervise a full chained tasks and people during the lenght of investment )

#### Example :

Mohammed Ben Salmane would like to limit the selling to 1 billion of Baril this year to 3 countries : France, USA, UK

##### The saleman
He will have to run with a proposal on 3 contracts on 3 differents regulator
You can redact a contract type that is aligned with the DIFC regulator, FED regulator and ECB regulator
This is easy task and the bank will not win a cent while been heavily exposed to lead the deal by filtering the cash payment according to schedule, you expose the bank to bankruptcy \
on any hasty assumptions

To avoid so, the saleman will assest the full scope of hidden lignes for this project and will try to protect the bank from a bad deal
Conduct a internal investigation to clearly understand how to run a drafted deal ( vanilla deal ) and modify accordingly between the fees the customer is willing to sacrify and the life-net of the bank

Selling in loop Rainbow Deal on S&P, SBF500, Tokyo Index compo, fixing every day = 5 hours of computation = 5 CPU to run the risk in 1h
selling 1000 of them = 5000 CPU = 1 new building to monopolize + 3500KWh = intrinsec cost 0.5 millions
request 1 dba and 1 admin and 1 risk of fire manager monopolized each day/nigh = instrinsec cost 0.3 millions

Total of margin burn with all cost : 1 millions / year

Fees of the bank > 1000 euro per deal
Imply minimum Notional value with 2BP margin = 5 million

Saleman publish Rainbow offer : 2BP, Quotity : 5million, 5y contract rainbow S&P, Tokyo Index compo, SBF500

For our case
The salemans will launch a request for price at the trader and the structure and handover the deal to the compliance and the risk manager while preparing multiple scenario 
He will need to callback the customers with example of price, versatility, pro and cons of each deal/solutions and engage the bank to be the garantor of the deal

Contract will be published in differente language , Arabic, English, French, American
Term and agreements will be checked if they are aligned with the contract proposale
Termsheet and Marketing document will be send and a follow up of different parties will be planned on each step of signing the contract

In the case of a decentralised bank like Bank4All, the follow up will be a block of procedurals Task as well as the sale own definition of running a customer ( Self producer or Trade secret )

Saleman will insert the client details into his own Block of TradedClient Vault

From the Vault can only be extracted the entity referential keys , the trade settled uid, the termsheet structure, the agent in bank who signed

The vault is decomposed into a multiple layer of secrecy

Unique [read/write] access of client contact guaranteed by either pinpoint location and device identifiation as well as antenna IIOR signature ( non known unique authentification factor )
Shared [read/write and modify later only] access with Director/Governor contract document and settlement negociation details
Shared [automate read] Audit/Regulator contract settlement signed and 
Shared [

he will composed a 3 swap of study 
1/3/ 12 GBrent USD/SAR every month, expiry EOY
1/3/ 12 GBrent EUR/SAR every month, expiry EOY
1/3/ 12 GBrent GBP/SAR every month, expiry EOY

Detect problem of volatility curve from 7months with past stress test , consider the bank will be forced to secure 40% of its own cash for liquidity in USD EUR and GBP
Request a collateral of 40% of cash as a safety net from Saudi that can manipulate market price to 20%

Decomposition will be justified as :
Request a collateral of 60% failure of delivery from USA operation as they publicized they will do action agaisnt saudi ( embargo or else )

##### The Trader
he will start to analyse the volatility of each asset represented on the contract
Check cross asset factorization, Beta impact, Barrier scheduling, Liquidity and reversability
Delivery a hedge plan for running the contract

BREND 95% USD every month 6th + Collateral rewarded USD/SAR
BREND 95% USD every month 6th + Collateral rewarded USD/SAR x GBP/USD
BREND 95% USD every month 6th + Collateral rewarded USD/SAR x EUR/USD

Generate a hedge structure for protecting the margin as 
12 Futures on BREND 95% USD
12 Futures USD/SAR

Sign or delegate some responsabilities 

##### The automatician
Receive a new demand of running a product decomposed as BRENT95 futures, requesting 12 banking event
- For Payment -> Insure Backoffice Treasure cluster can upload the charge of works and how many backup are updated
- For Compliance -> Insure Compliance system can turn within the time limit
- For RiskOp -> Projection of cost of CPU/GPU 
- For Storage -> Check capacity of database
- For Internet -> Check data provided extra cost for new asset market value
- For audit -> Check who have access, read , write, modify only once, stamp, testify
- For Report -> Add new ligne ( auto or manual )
- For TaskRunningBank -> Check Transaction is processed , stamped and in the correct state of been run by automate
- For Cleaning -> Check Logs and Ownership can reverse, can extract and can prove before/while and after
- For History -> Check operations can be reinstalled on new updated version ( time compability of bank event chain )

##### The audit
He will endorse the role of conformity and store all legal document required for any trials with his signature of quality control

He has control over list of counterparties for entity to entity block and regulator segment of activity as well as insure wall between transaction are effective

He need to insure all banking activity and control has been checked, enforced and will not risk the activity to be stopped or unrecognized or worst allow violation of regulators rules

- Highly difficult : Business validator of LAW text translater into Rules and Constraints
- Very difficult : Identify loophole of circular exposure
- Difficult : Validate complete transactions traces and report at any given time a full control of sides
- Average : Monitor how rules are applied, and verify perimeter and scope are clearly identified at referential level
- Medium : Validate impersonation, Business event,
